# EXEAppend : A PE File Appending Demo
# Written By : @Ice3man

I had originally written this project for development of a Zip To SFX Convertor.
But that project was abandoned and I was left with some code. I had nearly nailed
that one. But unfortunately, I abandoned the Idea. So, here it is. 

The core and crux of that Application Package. It works on the principle of appending 
at the end. Many things are lacking, you need to create a header for the program. It 
also has a fail-safe mechanism for extracting. 

If I get time in future, maybe I will complete it.
